**Deep Learning Specialization**
In the midst of COVID, when the world was terrorized by the nobel virus, when the hope to see a healthy world was blurring, I decided to enroll in a deep learning specialization certificate course to busy my mind in learning new skills. The certificate was issued in June 2020 by Coursera.

**Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**
After the graduation in MS in Computer Science from Texas A&M University, College Station, I decided to enroll in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course to enhance my knowledge in data science and analytics.
