#### Deep Learning Specialization

In the midst of COVID, when the world was terrorized by the nobel virus, when the hope to see a healthy world was blurring, I decided to enroll in a deep learning specialization certificate course to busy my mind in learning new skills. The certificate was issued in June 2020 by Coursera. Here is the certificate, [Deep Learning Specialization](https://github.com/sabinaadhikari20/sabinaadhikari/files/12005857/Deep_Learning_Specialization.pdf).
