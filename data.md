#### Data Scientist Intern

I worked as a Data Scientist Intern at Mattress Firm Inc in the summer of 2022. I was in a rotation program where I worked with Data Science team, Data Engineering Team, and Forecasting Team for a month each. Some of the responsibilities included:
- cleaning and organizing data
- performing initial data exploration
- applying statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to extract insights from data, building predictive models, and identifying patterns or trends
- identifying and creating relevant features or variables that could improve the performance of machine learning models
- building and fine-tuning machine learning models, evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics, and making recommendations for model improvement
- creating visual representations of data and analysis results to communicate findings effectively to supervisor
- working closely with other team members, such as data engineers, software developers, and business analysts, to gather requirements, exchange knowledge, and deliver data-driven solutions
- documenting the work, including data preprocessing steps, modeling techniques, and results, to ensure reproducibility and knowledge sharing within the team

While I was working with the Data Engineering Team, my responsibilities included:
- building and maintaining data pipelines to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from source systems to the data warehouse using Apache Airflow
- ensuring the quality and integrity of data by implementing data validation rules, performing data profiling, and addressing data quality issues
- assisting in the administration and maintenance of databases, including database monitoring, performance optimization, and troubleshooting
- supporting data governance initiatives by implementing data security measures, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, and assisting in the development of data privacy policies
- working with cloud platforms like Azure to deploy and manage data processing and storage infrastructure using service like Google
- documenting data engineering processes, workflows, and data pipelines to ensure knowledge transfer and maintainability


#### Graduate Research Assistant

I spent my entire graduate program working on a research project that involved data analysis and data science. Please find the details in the [Research & Training](/research) to learn more about my work as a research assistant. 


#### Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

After my graduation, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate to enhance my understanding on data analysis. Please refer to the [Certificate](/certificate)  to learn more about my certificate.

#### Data Science Competition

In the collobaroation with Texas A&M Forest Service (TFS), the Texas A&M Institute of Data Science (TAMUIDS) organized 2023 Data Science Competition. It was a Wildfire Data Science Challenge. On that very event, I and my team participated in the competition and won one of the best Midway Visualizations in the competition.


#### Cybersecurity Project

In the fall 2022, as a project for Software Engineering class, I and my team worked with the Department of Cybersecurity, Texas A&M University, College Station to help them develop an interacting website. Some of the problems they were having were:
- inconsistent record keeping
- duplicate records
- multiple source to register
- less security
- manual entry of records
  
We noted the problems of stakeholders and delivered an interactive website to solve the issues. Here are the things we did for this project:
- developed a website that read the uploaded CSV files and parsed the CSV files in the backend
- included features like editing the student information, super searching the information
- implemented React on the front end and ruby-on-rails on the back end
- deployed, managed, and scaled the apps using Heroku
- utilized the Scrum Software development methodology
The clients were satisfied with the work and the website is functioning at the moment.
