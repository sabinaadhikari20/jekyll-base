**Research Center**   

The upcoming big project is the establishment of the Research Center in Nepal. Nepal is in rich natural resources, medicinal herbs, and tranquil atmosphere. The compilation of the tall standing mountain, green and rich carpented hilly, rippling flow of rivers, and flat and comfortable terai make Nepal the most beautiful, healthy, and serene place on Earth. This is a holy land, the birthplace of Lord Gautam Buddha, pious Mata Sita, and the religious ground of Pashupatinath, Swoyambhunath, Muktinath and many other spiritual and holy places.

In all this beauty and magic, there lies abundant medicinal herbs that cure any illness that humans suffer on thi Earth. I am in search of that medicinal herbs. The main goal of this project is to reach out to people who followed the traditional ways to make medicines out of ayurveda and cure simple or deadly illness/diseases. It is important to record the ancient ways of curing different illness so that the humankind remain existing. This project involves 
- interviewing people who practice ayurveda and intake homemade medicines,
- surveying people who have been cured using medicinal herbs,
- collecting samples of different medicinal herbs found in different regions and recording their physical, chemical, and medicinal information
- finding out the chemical structure of each herbs
- recording what medicinal herbs cure what diseases through interview, surveys, and records
- tallying the chemical structure of the herbs to the diseases they cure
- backing the effectiveness of the cure with the scientific results
- bringing the medicines in the market

In the race of allopathic medicines and making billions of money out of selling the medicines with abundance side effects, presenting the actual medicines that can cure illness with less or no side effects is the main objective of this project. The resources that we need for this project are:
- **Money**: The first and foremost job is to survey and interview people. So, the field visit is a crucial part of this project. We are focusing on collecting data only from Nepal. Even though Nepal is a small country, it will take months to collect the data since each village, each family, each district practice different techniques and each region has different types of medicinal herbs available. So, we will require financial support to initiate the research. 
- **Local People**: We will rely a lot on the information provided by the local people. In return, we have to provide either monetary help to inspire them to share their stories. Thus, we need finacial support to encourage local people to participate in this project.
- **Scientist**: Scientists are the essential stakeholders on this venture. We will have a proof that the certain medicinal herbs work to cure certain diseases. We will have people who have been using them and being cured through it. The main reason why we need scientists is to back us by the scientific facts. It is easy for other people or competition to misrepresent us as hoax. Since we are certain that these medicinal herbs work and if we back this up by the science, our proof will be protected from all the areas. We are in a mission to help people, cure illness, and live a healthy and quality life.
- **Medicinal Herbs Enthusiast**: People who believe in ayurveda, medicinal herbs are diminishing day by day. As a way to preserve the traditional ways to cure people, we want ayurveda enthusiast in our team. They will lead us to the right people, right place for the collection of information.
- **Books**: There are thousands of books printed on the medicinal herbs. Different parts of the world use different techniques to cure their people. Books will be the best resoruce to tally the effectiveness and their wide use. 
- **Research Team**: A strong research team who believe in curing people and going extra miles to find the information is a must in this venture.
